This rule specifies the db schema and better-auth config for the `api` package.

For better-auth config, refer to [auth.ts](mdc:app/api/src/auth.ts).

For db schema, I use sqlite (libsql) with drizzle. Schema is in [schema.ts](mdc:app/api/src/db/schema.ts), and the `user`, `session`, `account` and `verification` tables are using better-auth's requirements.
